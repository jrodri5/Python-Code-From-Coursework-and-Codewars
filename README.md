# Python-Code-From-Coursework-and-CodeWars

Some assignments and lab work from my classes at Stevens Institute of Technology. I have revisited some of the assignments and revised them to improve the code to run better, be more concise and/or include extra functions. Along with this are some challenges that I have completed on CodeWars.

If you are a Stevens student seeing this repository, please note that the Stevens Honor System still applies to you, and viewing my work is meant to be for educational purposes only. You are NOT allowed to use my code and claim it as your own work for school. However, you are free to use anything else to improve the code, practice your skills, etc.
